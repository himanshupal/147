### Develop a Node.js API that:

- Accepts a new message, identifies the sender, the content, and the timestamp.
- Retrieves the last 50 messages in the chat when a new user joins the room.
- Implements a rate-limiting mechanism to restrict the number of messages a user can send within a certain timeframe (for instance, 15 messages per minute).
